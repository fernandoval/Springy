## What is this

Springy is a micro [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) framework for coders who work with the [PHP](http://www.php.net) script language to develop web applications.

It was created based upon the KISS principle in which the simplicity is the base to good things.
